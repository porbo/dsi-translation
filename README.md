Details in Spanish_Translation_Test.pdf

Initial findings:

Spain's conversions are all considered "control", and spain in general had higher conversion rates (regardless of the test).

My thinking was that this unfairly increased the conversion rate in the control group, but even after excluding spain the test group had lower conversion.

Quick t-test showed a pvalue around e-13. Very obviously not a random result.
