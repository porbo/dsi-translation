Details in Spanish_Translation_Test.pdf

Initial findings:

Spain's conversions are all considered "control", and spain in general had higher conversion rates (regardless of the test).

My thinking was that this unfairly increased the conversion rate in the control group, but even after excluding spain the test group had lower conversion.

Quick t-test showed a pvalue around e-13. Very obviously not a random result.


Noticed a bunch of people who aren't even using Spanish. Removed them from the test, but results didn't change.


On the other hand, after filtering, each individual country seems to have insignificant difference in conversion with/without test.
Maybe Argentina's high population and overall low conversion is messing things up?

By removing Argentina as well, the conversion rate difference becomes insignificant.
